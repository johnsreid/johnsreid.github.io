### !amazon
A link to some things that JSR is coveting. Because apparently he has to have one of these.

How many badgers must a man say before he's willing to wear a onesie on the internet? Find out with this command.

### !blame {username}
Who's gonna take the fall for _that_ happening? You decide.

### !commands
A link to this page!

### !death
How many times has JSR died in this game, or EVER?

## VIP commands

Uh oh, JSR has really died. Let's take that death off.

## Moderator commands
The stream wouldn't be what it is without the wonderful mods.

### !badger +
JSR said one of his famous badgers again! We keep track of this. Every 100 badgers there's a bonus onesie stream. If he says a worse word, there are additional points.

Just in case üòè

### !fireworks
Mods can launch fireworks to celebrate... just about anything.
